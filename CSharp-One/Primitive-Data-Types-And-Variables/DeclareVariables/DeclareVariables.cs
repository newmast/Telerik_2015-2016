 //Problem 1. Declare Variables

 //Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong to represent the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000.
 //Choose a large enough type for each number to ensure it will fit in it. Try to compile the code.

using System;

class DeclareVariables
{
    static void Main()
    {
        byte firstVar = 97;
        sbyte secondVar = -115;
        short thirdVar = -10000;
        ushort fourthVar = 52130;
        int fifthVar = 4825932;
    }
